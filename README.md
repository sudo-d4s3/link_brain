# What is link_brain
link_brain is a repository for links that are searchable via tags and have a preview of the site.

## Proof of Consept
this is a poc built in python, eventually it will be written in go, rust, or c and be a native app with a cli api. I built this in 4 days (3 with a day break inbetween).

## Known bugs
- Internal Error when adding a link
  - just refreash
- Able to add only a title, link, or tag 
  - no avilible fix but I have a suspicion that it appeared in my workaround for 2 forms on one page

## TODO
- overhaul to native app
- make the preview an actual preview
- implement an entry deletion function
- implement a tag deletion function

### TODO-possible
- full text search
- option for searching all tags instead of any tag in the search bar
