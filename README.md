# wtf am i
you are essentially a repository of links that are tagged with a search engine and spider for a preview
# TODO
- ~~create a database and link it to the frontend~~
- ~~create forms to add database entries~~
- ~~create a tagging system~~
- ~~make the tagging system render better~~
- ~~update forms to add tags to entries~~
- ~~ducktape a search engine onto it~~ (kinda, it only searches tags)
- ~~throw a spider on top~~ (super cheated with this, needs to be better)
